// Let's say you're writing an application that deals with processes on an operating system. Each process is identified by a unique positive integer identifier (called the pid). Processes can spawn arbitrarily many child processes. Each process has a unique parent process that spawned it, except for the special root process, which has no parent. With each process we also associate a ppid, or parent process identifier; for regular processes, this is the pid of the parent process, and for the root process, this is (arbitrarily) -1.
//
// Given the above description, it's natural to think of the processes on the operating system as forming a tree, rooted at the root process. You'd like to work with processes this way in your application. However, the API that the operating system exposes to you doesn't provide you with a tree, but with a flat list of objects -- each of which equipped with (among other metadata that we'll ignore) pid and ppid fields.
//
// 	For example, you might get something like this:
//
// const processes = [
// 	{pid: 1, ppid: -1},
// 	{pid: 219, ppid: 214},
// 	{pid: 214, ppid: 1},
// 	{pid: 124, ppid: 1}
// ];
// This represents a set of four processes; process 1 (the root process), its two children processes 124 and 214, and 214's child process 219.
//
// Your task is to take this flat list representation and create a proper tree out of it, with a node for each process and edges between parents and their children. Processes will be represented by a class Process:
//
// class Process {
// 	constructor(pid, children) {
// 		this.pid = pid;
// 		this.children = children;
// 	}
// }
// where pid is the integer pid and children is an array of children processes. Using this representation, the above set of processes might be represented as:
//
// 	new Process(1, [
// 		new Process(124, []),
// 		new Process(214, [
// 			new Process(219, []),
// 		]),
// 	])
// Note that you may not assume anything about the order of the processes in the list; you can't assume that the root process comes first, or that in general parents appear before their children. (If it helps, you may assume that any given process's pid is greater than its ppid.)
